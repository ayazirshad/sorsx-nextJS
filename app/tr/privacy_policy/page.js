                    <li>
                      When an employer, staffing firm, or recruiter (a
                      "Customer") uses SorsX to manage its hiring process, that
                      Customer is typically the controller of candidate data,
                      and SorsX processes candidate data on the Customer’s
                      behalf as a service provider/processor.

                      Separately, SorsX may operate the SorsX Candidate Database

                      features (including profiles derived from publicly
                      available sources and/or contributed through SorsX
                      workflows). For the SorsX Candidate Database, SorsX may
