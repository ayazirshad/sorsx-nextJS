                2. Who Is Responsible for Your Data (Controller vs. Processor)
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Hiring Organization processing:</strong>
                The Hiring Organization is generally responsible for your
                personal information in its hiring process. In that context,
                SorsX typically processes your information on behalf of the
                Hiring Organization as a service provider/processor to deliver
                the application, screening, and interview workflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SorsX candidate database processing:</strong>
                Separately, SorsX may maintain and operate a candidate database
                (the "SorsX Candidate Database") used for sourcing, matching,
                and headhunting features. For information stored and used in the
                SorsX Candidate Database (including information collected from
                publicly available sources and/or contributed through SorsX
                workflows), SorsX may act as an independent controller. This
                means SorsX may use that information to match you with
                opportunities across different SorsX customers and to enhance
                and enrich its sourcing dataset, subject to your opt-out/removal
                rights described below.

              <p>
                Depending on the role and configuration, the Hiring Organization

                </li>
                <li>
                  Information from publicly available sources (for example,

                  candidate profiles in the SorsX Candidate Database.

              <h3>5. Recording and AI Processing</h3>
              <p>
                Your interview may be recorded (audio and/or video) and
                transcribed. The Hiring Organization may use SorsX AI-enabled
                tools to generate summaries, scores, and other evaluation
                outputs. AI outputs are probabilistic and may be inaccurate. The
                Hiring Organization is responsible for making all hiring
                decisions and for appropriate human review.
