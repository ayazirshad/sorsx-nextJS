                responsible for Marketplace Providers, their services, candidate
                submissions, or compliance with Applicable Laws. Customer is
                responsible for setting, paying, and administering any success
                fees or other compensation owed to Marketplace Providers.

                Customer will ensure that use of the Services and Outputs does

                Customer is solely responsible for compliance with Applicable
                Laws, including CAN-SPAM, TCPA, and similar laws outside the

              <p>
                Customer grants SorsX the right to use Customer Data (including
                Candidate Data) to operate, maintain, secure, support, and
                improve the Services, including to develop, train, validate, and

              </p>
              <p>
                To the extent SorsX uses Customer Data for training or
                improvement purposes, SorsX will apply commercially reasonable
                measures designed to (a) remove or scrub direct identifiers, (b)
                minimize use of personal data, and (c) reduce the risk of bias
                in training datasets, consistent with SorsX's internal policies
                and the nature of the Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                SorsX may also create and use aggregated and de-identified data
                derived from Customer Data for lawful business purposes,
                including analytics, benchmarking, and improvement of the
                Services, provided such data does not identify Customer or any
                individual.

              <p>
                If Customer uses sourcing features, Customer acknowledges that
                the Services may display or provide access to candidate profiles
                from the SorsX Candidate Database and may store certain

                <strong>Candidate removal requests:</strong> SorsX may receive

                from the SorsX Candidate Database (including via a "Remove My
                Info" form). Customer agrees that, upon SorsX’s reasonable

                information in Customer’s systems to the extent required by

              <p>
                Customer will pay all fees set forth in the applicable Order
                ("Fees"). Unless otherwise specified in the Order, Fees are due
                in advance, are non-cancelable, and (except as required by law)
                non-refundable, and are not subject to set-off.
              </p>

              <h4>5.2 Automatic Renewal; Non-Renewal Notice</h4>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise specified in an Order, subscriptions
                automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration
                at SorsX's then-current rates.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prevent renewal, Customer must provide written notice by
                email to Customer's designated account manager (or to such email
                address as SorsX designates in writing for renewals) at least
                thirty (30) days before the end of the then-current term (a
                "Non-Renewal Notice"). If SorsX does not receive a timely
                Non-Renewal Notice, the subscription will renew.
              </p>

              <h4>5.3 Payment Processing; Late Payments; Suspension</h4>
              <p>
                If Customer pays by credit card or other electronic method,
                Customer authorizes SorsX (and its payment processor) to charge
                the payment method for Fees and applicable taxes. For invoiced
                amounts, payment terms are net thirty (30) days unless otherwise
                specified. Past due amounts may accrue interest at the lesser of
                1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law. SorsX may
                suspend access to the Services for overdue amounts or other
                material breaches.
              </p>

              <h4>5.4 Taxes</h4>
              <p>
                Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
                taxing authorities. Customer is responsible for all such taxes
                except taxes based on SorsX's net income. If Customer is
                required to withhold taxes, Customer will gross up payments so
                that SorsX receives the full amount invoiced.
              </p>

              <h4>5.5 NO REFUNDS; CHARGEBACKS</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND

                Customer will not initiate chargebacks or payment disputes for
                authorized charges. If Customer initiates a chargeback in breach
                of this section, SorsX may suspend access and Customer will
                reimburse SorsX for amounts charged back and any reasonable

                Upon expiration or termination, Customer's right to access and
                use the Services will cease. Customer remains responsible for
                all Fees accrued through the effective date of termination, and
                any unpaid Fees become immediately due.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise agreed in an Order, SorsX may delete Customer
